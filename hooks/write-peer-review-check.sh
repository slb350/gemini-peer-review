**Peer Review Check:** You're about to write implementation code.

If this is part of a larger implementation plan that hasn't been peer reviewed, consider:
1. Pausing to dispatch to `gemini-peer-review:gemini-peer-reviewer` with your design
2. Then proceeding with implementation after validation

Skip this if: trivial change, bug fix, or design was already peer reviewed.
